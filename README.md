# Introduction
The purpose of this case study is to offer another illustration of market segmentation analysis using a different empirical data set. This data set was collected originally for the purpose of comparing the validity of a range of different answer formats in survey research investigating brand image. Descriptions of the data are available in Dolnicar and Leisch (2012), Dolnicar and Grün (2014), and Grün and Dolnicar (2016). Package MSA contains the sections of the data used in this case study. For this case study, imagine that you are McDonald’s, and you would want to know if consumer segments exist that have a distinctly different image of McDonald’s. Understanding such systematic differences of brand perceptions by market segments informs which market segments to focus on, and what messages to communicate to them. We can choose to focus on market segments with a positive perception, and strengthen the positive perception. Or we can choose to focus on a market segment that currently perceives McDonald’s in a negative way. In this case, we want to understand the key drivers of the negative perception, and modify them.

# 📖Data Description
The data set contains responses from 1453 adult Australian consumers relating to their perceptions of McDonald’s with respect to the following attributes: YUMMY, CONVENIENT, SPICY, FATTENING, GREASY, FAST, CHEAP, TASTY, EXPENSIVE, HEALTHY, and DISGUSTING. These attributes emerged from a qualitative study con�ducted in preparation of the survey study. For each of those attributes, respondents provided either a YES response (indicating that they feel McDonald’s possesses this attribute), or a NO response (indicating that McDonald’s does not possess this attribute).

# 📖Conclusion
After the market segmentation analysis is completed, and all strategic and tactical marketing activities have been undertaken, the success of the market segmentation strategy has to be evaluated, and the market must be carefully monitored on a continuous basis. It is possible, for example, that members of segment 3 start earning more money and the MCSUPERBUDGET line is no longer suitable for them. Changes can occur within existing market segments. But changes can also occur in the larger marketplace, for example, if new competitors enter the market. All potential sources of change have to be monitored in order to detect changes which require McDonald’s management to adjust their strategic or tactical marketing in view of new market circumstances
